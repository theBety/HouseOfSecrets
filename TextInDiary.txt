Manzanillo 1847

They don't stop. They're following me, every day, every hour, every minute. They're on me.
I can feel their eyes on me. They're burning into my skin. I need someone to help me, something that will chase them away.
Nicolas gave me this thing, an old cursed amulet. It should make them go away. But will it be enough? Will it stop them?
I have the amulet in my right pocket, it has to be in the right one, IT HAS TO. They're still here, I can feel them.
Nicolas told me to be careful with it. Apparently, this amulet is an old enchanted object, it has been found in hand of a dead pirate.
There are legends that captain of an old ship had found it in old cave and short after died of an unknown cause.

Nick also gave me boxes full of cursed or enchanted objects. Sometimes they give me chills, but I'm not some kind of coward
to be scared of few watches, compasses and lighters.
