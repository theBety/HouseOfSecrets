*You woke up in basement without your friends or any idea how you've got there. You need to escape and find you friends!*
OH MY GOD, where am I? What I'm doing here? Where are my friends? I should probably look around. Hmm, the only thing I see are old boxes.
Damn it, what do I do?
Wait, What's this? There's some book in a corner.
That was almost 200 years ago. So I think that all of these boxes are full of cursed things. GREAT. I need to get out asap. But how?
